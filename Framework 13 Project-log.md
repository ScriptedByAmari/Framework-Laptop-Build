Framework Laptop 13 DIY Build & Dual-Boot Project

üìå Project Overview

This project documents my hands-on assembly and configuration of a Framework Laptop 13 (Intel Core Ultra Series 1).

Goals:
- Assemble modular laptop hardware from components
- Set up a dual-boot system (Windows 11 + Ubuntu)
- Troubleshoot hardware/software compatibility issues
- Demonstrate job-relevant IT skills (hardware, OS config, BIOS, dual-booting, system recovery)

Reasoning for Dual-Boot Setup:
- Career Relevance: Many IT support, infrastructure, and sysadmin environments involve working across both Windows and Linux. This setup lets me practice administration, troubleshooting, and configuration in both platforms.
- Full Hardware Access: Running Linux on bare metal provides full performance and access to hardware-level features, unlike in VMs or WSL where virtualisation overhead and abstraction can limit certain operations.
- Real-World Tasks: Enables hands-on learning of partition management, bootloader configuration, BIOS/UEFI interactions, and OS recovery processes ‚Äî all of which are relevant for enterprise support work.
- Skill Demonstration: Shows the ability to plan, implement, and troubleshoot a multi-OS environment, preparing me for scenarios where cross-platform support is required.

This serves as both a personal learning project and a technical portfolio piece relevant to roles in IT support, infrastructure, or system administration.

üîß Build Log

(Based on the official Framework Quick Start Guide: https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Framework+Laptop+13+(Intel+Core+Ultra+Series+1)+DIY+Edition+Quick+Start+Guide/332?lang=en)

Step-by-Step Assembly:
1. Installed RAM modules in both slots for dual-channel performance
   Tip: Dual-channel provides better memory bandwidth now, making the system more responsive for multitasking and virtual machines.
   Note: On my unit, Channel 0 was the left-hand side slot and had the reversed notch. This meant the chips needed to face down for that slot ‚Äî the opposite of what some guides may imply.
   It‚Äôs essential to visually confirm slot orientation before inserting DDR5 RAM to avoid forcing or misalignment.
   When upgrading in future, I can resell these sticks to offset the cost.
2. Installed 2 TB WD_Black SN850X NVMe SSD
   Tip: Chosen over the 1 TB SN770 for both performance (faster sequential and random speeds) and capacity (~150% more usable space post-OS/tool install). The larger drive allows more headroom for OS partitions, VM images, and project storage, reducing upgrade pressure.
4. Attached input cover and connected keyboard ribbon cables
5. Inserted expansion cards (USB-C, USB-A, DisplayPort)
6. Screwed in the bezel and secured chassis
7. Powered on and confirmed POST

## üîê Pre-Install Backup Strategy

To protect my Windows setup before attempting the Ubuntu dual-boot installation, I created a full system image backup using **AOMEI Backupper Standard** (free edition):

- ‚úÖ **System Image**: Backed up the full Windows 11 OS and all EFI/system partitions to an external drive with sufficient space
- ‚úÖ **Recovery Media**: Created a bootable USB recovery drive via AOMEI in case the OS became unbootable
- üß† **File Safety**: My external drive already had files on it; I created a separate backup folder (`FrameworkBackup_2025-09`) to avoid overwriting anything
- üß™ **Tested Restore Plan**: Verified that I could boot into the recovery USB and access the image if a restore was needed

This gave me the confidence to proceed with dual-boot partitioning, knowing I could fully revert if needed.

üíæ Operating System Setup

Partitioning & Prep
- Initial plan was to use Ventoy on a 32 GB USB stick to load both Ubuntu 24.04 and Windows 11 ISOs.
  - Multiple installation attempts failed on both old and brand-new 32 GB USB sticks, even after running as administrator, using DiskPart to wipe the drive, and disabling antivirus protection. 
  - Each attempt resulted in mid-process errors, leaving the USB unreadable and unformatable via standard Windows tools.
  - Decided to abandon Ventoy due to repeated reliability issues in favour of a more predictable, tool-specific method.
- Created two separate dedicated bootable USB sticks using Rufus:
  1. **Windows 11 USB** ‚Äì Prepared via Rufus using GPT/UEFI partition scheme, NTFS file system, and with BitLocker automatic device encryption disabled for dual-boot compatibility. Also configured to bypass TPM/online account requirements for flexibility.
  2. **Ubuntu 24.04 USB** ‚Äì Prepared via Rufus using GPT/UEFI partition scheme and FAT32 file system for maximum compatibility.
- This dual-stick approach ensures each OS has its own dedicated bootloader, reducing the chance of conflicts and simplifying the installation process.
- Planned installation order: Install Windows 11 first, then Ubuntu into the unallocated space so that GRUB can handle dual-boot management.
- Disabled Secure Boot and set boot order via BIOS prior to installations.

OS Installs
1. Installed Windows 11 Home first (for easier bootloader control)
   - Activated Windows using a purchased product key during the installation process.
   - Also signed in with my Microsoft account during setup, but no linked licence was associated with this new device.
2. Installed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS into unallocated space using 'Something else' partitioning:
   - Created an 80 GB ext4 partition for `/`
   - Installed GRUB bootloader to the root NVMe drive (`/dev/nvme0n1`)
3. Verified successful dual-boot: GRUB displays both Ubuntu and Windows options on boot.
   - To switch between OSes, I use the BIOS boot menu (F2 on Framework Laptop).

Post-Install Tasks
- Installed drivers for both OS environments
- Verified Linux kernel compatibility with Framework hardware

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Fixes

Issue | Fix
--- | ---
BIOS not detecting bootable USB | Recreated ISO with Rufus and used USB 2.0 port
Ventoy install failing mid-process on 32 GB USB (Windows unable to format stick afterwards) | Tried admin rights, DiskPart clean, and antivirus exclusions ‚Äî still failed. Likely ageing USB controller or bad sectors. Ordered two new 32 GB sticks; plan to retry Ventoy on one and use the second for a dedicated Windows 11 installer via Rufus as a backup.
Older USB not bootable after Ventoy attempt | Wiped partitions with DiskPart; still unstable ‚Äî confirmed media replacement was the best resolution.
AV deleting Ventoy zip on download | Switched to downloading from official GitHub release page (v1.1.05) to avoid false positive triggers.

## üìö Lessons Learned from USB Prep

- **Hardware Reliability Matters** ‚Äì Even if a USB stick works for basic storage, it may fail when subjected to repeated raw writes during bootloader installation.  
- **Always Have Redundancy** ‚Äì A secondary USB for a dedicated Windows installer ensures you‚Äôre never stranded, even if your multi-boot stick fails.  
- **Source Trust** ‚Äì Downloading from official GitHub releases prevented antivirus false positives and guaranteed file authenticity.  
- **Layered Troubleshooting** ‚Äì Systematically tried permission elevation, drive wipes, and AV exclusions before concluding the issue was hardware-related.  
- **Time Management Under Constraints** ‚Äì Adapted plan quickly knowing PC access was time-limited before return, ensuring new media was ordered in time.

ü™û Reflection

Choosing dual-channel 2√ó16 GB RAM over a single 32 GB stick was intentional ‚Äî this setup offers better memory bandwidth immediately, improving performance for VMs, multitasking, and OS testing. I can still upgrade later and recoup some cost by selling the current kit.

Upgrading to a 2 TB high-performance NVMe SSD was also deliberate. It balances performance gains with practical capacity needs for a dual-boot environment, giving ~150% more usable space after OS/tool installs compared to a 1 TB drive, and ensuring the system remains future-proof for my lab work and experiments.

The dual-boot configuration is central to the project‚Äôs learning value:
- It reflects real enterprise scenarios where both Windows and Linux systems are in use.
- It enables full-speed, bare-metal Linux use without virtualisation overhead.
- It allows me to practice hardware-level admin tasks like partitioning, bootloader setup, and recovery processes.
- It demonstrates my ability to plan, implement, and troubleshoot a multi-OS environment ‚Äî skills directly relevant to cross-platform IT roles.


CPU Choice Update:
Initially, I considered the Intel Core Ultra 5 125H, but ultimately chose the Ultra 7 155H. 
The rationale was simple: for only an ~8% increase in cost, the Ultra 7 provides stronger multi-threaded performance, 
higher efficiency for demanding workloads, and greater longevity for a dual-boot development environment. 
This ensures I won‚Äôt need to upgrade as soon, while keeping total system cost in check.
## üìù Corrections & Variations

- üß† **RAM Slot Orientation:** Contrary to the general expectation, Channel 0 on this unit was on the **left-hand side**, with the **reversed notch**. This required inserting the DDR5 stick with **chips facing down** on the left side ‚Äî a notable variation that other builders should visually confirm before applying pressure.
