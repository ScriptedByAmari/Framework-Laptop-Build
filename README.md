# Framework Laptop 13 DIY Build (Aug–Sept 2025)

This project documents the full assembly and configuration of a modular Framework Laptop 13 (DIY Edition), from component installation through to a completed dual-boot Windows 11 + Ubuntu setup.

The build log captures hardware assembly, BIOS configuration, operating system installation, troubleshooting, and post-installation validation. It serves as both a personal learning exercise and a technical portfolio artefact demonstrating practical IT skills.
